              <p>
                Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                available on the WHO website and through your national and local
                public health authority. Most people who become infected
                experience mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe
                for others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing
                the following:

            <h2>What Is Coronavirus?</h2>
            <p>
              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              a new virus. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu)
              with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases,
              difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your
              hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close
              contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
            </p>

            <p>
              COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019.
              Although health officials are still tracing the exact source of
              this new coronavirus, early hypotheses thought it may be linked to
              a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Some people who visited the
              market developed viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus. A
              study that came out on Jan. 25, 2020, notes that the individual
              with the first reported case became ill on Dec. 1, 2019, and had
              no link to the seafood market. Investigations are ongoing as to
              how this virus originated and spread.

                  are in an open-air environment, the use of face mask is not
                  very efficient.

                  Social distancing puts space between people. When people who
                  are infected with the virus stay away from others, they can't
                  pass it to anyone else. This way, fewer people get sick at the
                  same time. Then, doctors and hospitals are better able to keep
                  up with treating those who need care.

                  If you're like most teens, you've left your health care up to
                  your parents. After all, they care about your health as much
                  as you do. But nobody knows more about your body than you: You
                  live in it and you're the one who knows when something doesn't
                  feel right. Taking charge of your health care lets you make
                  choices that affect you every day. It also prepares you for
                  the time when you'll be the one buying health insurance or
                  making decisions for your own kids.

                Many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands
                with soap and clean, running water. ... Handwashing with soap
                removes germs from hands. This helps prevent infections because:
                People frequently touch their eyes, nose, and mouth without even
                realizing it

              <h3>Maintain social distancing</h3>
              <p>
                While it may be disappointing to hear that so many sports
                events, cruises, festivals and other gatherings are being
                cancelled, there is a public health reason for these measures.
                These cancellations help stop or slow down the spread of disease
                allowing the health care system to more readily care for
                patients over time. Cancelling events that are likely to draw
                crowds is an example of social distancing. Social distancing is
                deliberately increasing the physical space between people to
                avoid spreading illness. Staying at least six feet away from
                other people lessens your chances of catching COVID-19.

              <h3>Avoid touching face</h3>
              <p>
                The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is believed to be spread
                mostly by inhaling droplets released when an infected individual
                coughs or sneezes. But these droplets can also land on surfaces
                that we touch with our hands. “Some pathogens can last for about
                nine days on surfaces, so we are constantly coming in contact
                with potential pathogens that can cause an infection,” said
                Jennifer Hanrahan, chief of the division of infectious diseases
                at the University of Toledo Medical Center.

                The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to
                this virus. The CDC always recommends everyday preventive
                actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases,
                including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid
                touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are
                sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the
                tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched
                objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or
                wipe.
